# Fred's Blog

This is a basic blog developed in order to practice [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/) and the [EJS view engine](https://ejs.co/).

This blog implements basic CRUD functionality and follows the MVC design pattern. It was created for learning purposes only. As a result, the styling was kept minimal with no images or animations and just a single font.

Thanks for visiting!
